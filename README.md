## Introduction

The Bookstore API is designed to help users manage a virtual bookstore. It offers four primary API endpoints for interacting with the book data:

- **Create Book**: Add a new book to the database using a POST request.
- **Get Book**: Retrieve all books or a single book by its ID using GET requests.
- **Update Book**: Update the information of a specific book using a PUT request.
- **Delete Book**: Delete a book from the database using a DELETE request.

These APIs allow users to perform essential book-related operations efficiently.
